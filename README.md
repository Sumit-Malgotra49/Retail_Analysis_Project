Analyze region-wise performance

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies Used
Python (for data cleaning and preprocessing)

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for analysis & visualization)

Power BI (for building the interactive dashboard)

ðŸ§© Key Steps Involved
Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and formatted dates.

Profitability Analysis: Calculated profit margins across categories and sub-categories.

Inventory Turnover: Identified slow- and fast-moving products using sales vs. quantity.

ðŸ“Š Deliverables
âœ… Cleaned Dataset (CSV or Excel format)

âœ… Python Scripts for Data Processing

âœ… Power BI Dashboard (.pbix)

âœ… Final Report (2-page PDF with key findings)

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
Certain categories have significantly lower profit margins and need attention.

Some products are slow movers, tying up capital in unsold inventory.

Seasonal trends were observed during the holiday and back-to-school periods.

The West and Central regions generated the highest revenue.

ðŸ“Ž Final Output
The final interactive dashboard allows users to filter by product category, region, and time period, giving them a powerful tool to make data-driven decisions in real-time.
